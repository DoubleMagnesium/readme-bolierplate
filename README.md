As everything is changing all the time the production readiness of this project and its future development are
in permanent question unless it is clearly stated otherwise.
Use of this product is entirely on your own risk. *Nobody (including me) guarantees that there is no bugs present in the code.*
I dont' have much time to eliminate them all but hardly trying to minimize them.
